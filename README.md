This is my first mod

Forge version - [1.20.1-47.3.0](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html)

As of currently - All the textures are placeholders (please don't take them seriously)
There are only limited features currently and slowly but surely I'll work on more

Current features:
- OreGen
- TreeGen
- Custom Villager (Doesn't have texture)
- Custom Machines (require outside power generation)
- JEI Integration


When mod will be ready for release - it will be released in CurseForge
