This is my first mod

As of currently - All the textures are placeholders (please don't take them seriously)
There are only limited features currently and slowly but surely I'll work on more

Current features:
- OreGen
- TreeGen
- Custom Villager (Doesn't have texture)
- Custom Machines (require outside power generation)
- JEI Integration
